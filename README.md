# Zero hours contracts
Understand zero hours contracts. How did they become so prevelant? When and why? what policy drove this? when are they good and bad? is their rise in any way linked to IR35 which caused lack of mutualty of obligation (essentially zero hours) to become part of standard T&C?
## My goals
Put to test what I learned on the Oxford PPE courses
For the data aspects, create a resource of reliable overview graphics
For the non-data aspects, provide a report which has had scrutiny from both academics and those inovlved in politics at a semi-professional quality level
## Project planning
Look for sources of data
Look for published work
Ask LSE and Oxford if anyone could mentor me
Overview graphics to show Zero Hours contracts over time
Definition of zero hours contracts and identify key sub-categories
